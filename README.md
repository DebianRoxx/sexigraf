SexiGraf is a fully open-source vSphere centric Graphite VMware appliance with a Grafana frontend. It pulls VI and VSAN metrics from VMware vCenter APIs, push them to Graphite and let Grafana produces the gorgeous dashboards we love so much!

*Official website for this awesome appliance is available at http://www.sexigraf.fr*

## VMware VSAN

The metrics used in the various VSAN dashboards are collected every minutes using to the QueryVsanStatistics API method of HostVsanInternalSystem. With some json ticks, it is possible to access any metrics from the VSAN cluster. And guess what! Weâ€™re already working on other cool SexiPanels for VSAN: http://www.sexigraf.fr/vsan-sexipanels/
